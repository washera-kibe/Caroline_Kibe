Project: Master Timetable for 2024/2025 Academic Year

# Description
This project involves the creation and organization of a comprehensive master timetable for the 2024/2025 school academic year. It is designed for teachers, students, and school administrators to ensure the efficient allocation of subjects, classes, and resources throughout the school week. The schedule includes lessons, breaks, lunch times, clubs, debates, games, and special sessions such as Mind Lectures and Form Tutorâ€™s Time. The timetable enables the smooth operation of day-to-day academic and extracurricular activities while accommodating multiple year groups.

# Accessibility Considerations
In creating and distributing the timetable, the following accessibility considerations are recommended:

# Digital Accessibility:
Offer the timetable in accessible digital formats (e.g., PDF with screen reader compatibility or HTML for web accessibility).
Ensure proper formatting for assistive technologies such as text magnifiers and screen readers.

# Color Contrast:
Utilize high-contrast colors in the timetable to accommodate individuals with color blindness or visual impairments.

# Font Size and Readability:
Use clear, legible fonts and appropriate font sizes (minimum 12pt or higher) to make the timetable accessible to users with low vision.

# Language Support:
Provide translations or multilingual versions for schools where students speak different languages.
